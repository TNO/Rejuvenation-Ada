   --                            we will duplicate trivia.
   --                            E.g. "Node1; -- comment Node2;"
   --  when we limit trivia to one direction (before / after node),
   --  we still miss trivia (before/after) keywords e.g.
   --  (if -- missed_after Condition -- missed_before then ...)
