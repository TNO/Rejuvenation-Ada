   --  Current implementation doesn't work around libadalang limitation:
   --
   --  LIBADALANG.PROJECT_PROVIDER.UNSUPPORTED_VIEW_ERROR:
   --  selected project is aggregate and has more than one sub-project
   --
   --  TODO: Make a workable / reasonable solution!
   --  suggestions / background info:
   --
   --  The situation is more nuanced: even though indeed a given Libadalang
   --  context cannot see whole aggregate projects when they contain
   --  "conflicting" units, it is perfectly possible for a single command to
   --  create one context per aggregated project and run your analysis on all
   --  of them. This specific case is illustrated in our documentation with
   --  an example: see
   --  <https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/libadalang/html/libadalang_ug/
   --   examples/aggregate_projects.html
   --   #creating-one-provide-context-for-each-aggregated-project>.
   --
   --  Note that because of the semantics of aggregate projects, it would
   --  make no sense for a single Libadalang context to see units from all
   --  aggregated projects at once without adding much complexity to the
   --  Libadalang API. For instance, given that multiple units may define the
   --  same type several times, the P_Referenced_Decl property would need to
   --  be modified to return not "THE declaration" referenced by some
   --  expression, but all declarations it may refer to (depending on the
   --  "view" inside the aggregated project). This would be probably a great
   --  burden for both us (Libadalang implementers) and all Libadalang users
   --  (need to deal with a much more complex API even when not dealing with
   --  aggregate projects).
