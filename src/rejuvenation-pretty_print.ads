package Rejuvenation.Pretty_Print is
   --  TODO: what if we only want to insert (append/prepend) code that
   --  should be pretty printed?
   --  In that case we have no node (yet) to surround
   --  with pretty print section!

   --  This functionality support the following flow
   --  1. Enter flags to specify exactly those sections that should be
   --     affected by pretty printing.
   --  2. Enter flag at the start of the file to turn pretty printing
   --     initially off.
   --  3. Pretty print the sections in the file
   --  4. Remove the flags related to this functionality
   --
   --  Note: Nesting of pretty print sections is allowed (unlike by GNATpp).
   --
   --  Note: Since the file might already contain user defined
   --        pretty print sections, the provided flags are made unique
   --        for this functionality.
   --
   --  See https://gt3-prod-1.adacore.com/#/tickets/U722-009 :
   --  GNATpp requires that the flags must appear on a line by themselves, with
   --  nothing preceding except spaces
   --
   --  To ensure that the pretty print flags appear on a line by themselves,
   --  with nothing preceding except spaces,
   --  users can't access the flags directly.
